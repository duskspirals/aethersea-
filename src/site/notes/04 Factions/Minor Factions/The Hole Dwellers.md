The Hole Dwellers, otherwise known as 'The Children of Tartarus' is a cult spread across the galaxy, taking refuge deep underground of nearly every realm.

They call themselves 'Clots'... Spending even a couple weeks with them you completely insane, but those who last 6 more are clottified, and claim to have an 'elevated' form of sanity.Â
