The avatars are 7 deities who could be considered gods to some. Each Avatar represents a deadly sin.

Avatars are chosen when the previous perishes- Its not known exactly how they are chosen, they just sort of *are*- Though the person will usually have an extremely high capacity for that particular sin's power.

once you are an avatar you are immune to death by natural causes (old age, disease, etc)

#### Serving Avatars
Serving the avatars requires giving up your soul. The rewards are based off the avatar and their vice, but for example with Lust you get to have scary orgies and Greed's workers are so  moneyhungry for promotions that they kill eachother

 if u decide to serve an avatar you get a permenant tatoo if their symbol on your back, Even if u escape. 

You escape by giving up that vice and choosing to leave. you cant just run away out of fear. There has to be remorse involved
