#faction

The faction belonging to the kingdom of [[Abyssia\|Abyssia]]. 

There are three Divisions:

### **The Navy**

- The sailors, captains, and officers who command the ships and do things like patrolling, combat, and exploration.
- Protect the land from major external threats. 
- Their main priority at the moment is putting a stop to the [[04 Factions/02 Pirates\|02 Pirates]] 

### **The Royal Guards**

- Responsible for maintaining order, defending major cities, and solving crimes. They enforce laws, stop criminals, and protect from internal threats. Could be seen as guards sort of with 10 times the responsibility
  
- The Guards are more stop minor threats and solve disputes while the Navy handles bigger threats that require more tactician.
### **The Union**

- These are the people who keep the navy running behind the scenes. They build and repair ships, manage supplies, train recruits, and overall do the labourwork.
- If someone is caught doing a crime- they may offer to do labor for the union in exchange for a lighter sentence. Some are just straight up punished as doing service for the union. This is a pretty popular way of reform unless you're a GENUINE danger to yourself and others
