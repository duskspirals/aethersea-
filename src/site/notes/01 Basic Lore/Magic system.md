There are seven Gods.

each god has a gimic that can grant overs power one way or another, like Lust has a drug thay can make u more powerful maybe reinhardt has weapons blahblah blah idk work in concept, and then envy's main bit is their blood which, sucks fir them

but like you have 7 'deities' to choose from and you can form a 'pact' and you get power. The gods can also take it away it so its a win win.

it does give them extra power having more loyal followers, plus they can use them for dirtywork (*like with zero and sheen*)
