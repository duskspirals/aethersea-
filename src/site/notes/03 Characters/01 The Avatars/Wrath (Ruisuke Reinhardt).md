## Lore

- Grew up in an orphanage, due to being abnormally tall and quiet he was seen as a protector and actually stopped other people from being picked on.
- He left early when he was 14 to enlist in the war at the time-  Due to feeling purposeless and talentless. He would become addicted to what would later be known as  '[[07 Items/Drugs/Gunpowder\|Gunpowder]]'- He was known for being an introvert who dis-ensembled and re-ensembled his gun in his past time.
- War fucked him up HORRIBLY and he was forced to grow up and mature triple the rate he already was. 
- The war went on for 7 years- and Rein's side was the losing one. He was very normal about all that loss being for nothing. He got a medal though
- Way too soon Afterwards, Reinhardt met his first wife. They both got married at 21 and had a child together, Enzio Reinhardt. 
- Reinhardt retired early and lived with his wife and child for the next 20, peaceful years. 
- Until he was 40, he was forcefully re-enlisted into another war which was a sequel to the one he fought in.  This one was twice as brutal- and his son chose to enlist died. 
- His wife killed herself while he was gone and he got the news about both right as he was about to be sent into a big battle.  Their side was being slaughtered and was 98% down. 
- Anyways Wrath was looking for a proper candidate so when Reinhardt turned into a God mid battle and completely turned the tides, it had chosen a good host.
- He spent a very long time in his Griffin form, Taking control of Grimm and COMPLETELY threatening to murder and wipe out any part of this realm that tries to fight each other. One of the holds did so he wiped them out. Now for the last 600 years, there have been close to no conflict.
- He's known as a merciless ruler and rules with an iron fist. At the same time- he is hands off. He doesn't enjoy his life but he doesn't trust anyone else to be where he is.

1. Cue. Feels insanely bad for her and projects himself onto her.
2. Groodus. Respects her for how long shes been around for. Has the tiniest bit of trust in her.
3. Sheen. Sees him as a bumbling idiot- but has a bad feeling about him.
4. Porter. Vibes dont matter because he is actively fucking awful and he hates him...I guess he respects the fact that he has limits unlike-
5. Wart. Can tell shes insanely selfish and is horrified of the damage she causes-
6. Davit. Tossup for the last two, sees him as a despicable but also like sheen a complete idiot. I think he'd hate davit more because he's more conniving and conscious of his harm then Wart.
