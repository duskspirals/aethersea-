#avatar #character







1 - Reinhardt. Even if he doesn't adopt her I think she trust him the most.  
2 - Sheen. She's stupid and easy to fool, she def falls for his silly goofy persona  
3 - Groodus. Groodus has def yelled at her a few times but she always apologizes and comforts her after she starts crying.  
4 - Porter. Mean :(  
5 - Wart. Even though Wart just woke up she's instantly made a bad impression on Cue immediately groping her.  
6 - Davie. I mean come on.
