#### Opinions 

1. Cue, idk I think she just finds her inoffensive. Not that she likes her but she'd proterct her if reinhardt wasnt there  
3. Reinhardt. I assume they fight a lot considering they both have tempers, but she respects his sigma male grindset  
4. Davie, and I donâ€™t think she has as much beef with him as he thinks. I mean she would want to see his body smeared across the pavement but its not that serious.  
5. Porter, annoying prick  
6. Sheen, he makes her deeply uncomfortable cause she know that boy has tricks.
7. Wart
