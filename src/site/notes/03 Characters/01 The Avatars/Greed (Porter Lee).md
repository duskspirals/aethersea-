#avatar #character

Was a rich kid who hated having everything handed to him- so he struck out on his own to go gain everything himself.

Killed the past god of greed with his bare hands to get his power. Unfortunate.


#### Avatar opinion tierlist


1. **Cue** An Annoying brat but he thinks she'd get in his way the least. Pities her and thinks shes too pathetic to be that mean to.
2. **Sheen**. Hates him but he's cooperative. Thinks hes a vapid moronish child.
3. **Groodus**  Doesn't bother him. stays in her own lane. Fine. Whatever.
4. **Reinhardt** PROBABLY Actively wants to kill him but he has the SMALLEST amount of respect for him. 
5. **Wart** Finds her actually a little intimidating even for him. Does not listen.
6. **Davit** Fuck him. Does not respect him. Does not enjoy him. Views him as a cockroach
