## Personality
**Enneagram 3** (Attaching self esteem to their hustle)
*Skills, Hobbies, Habits, Tastes, Lifestyle, Dialogue, Temperment, Weaknesses, Relationships, Presentation*
- He has very erratic movements, like hes constantly on edge.
- Extraordinarily 'joyful' but not entirely in an honest way
- Speaks whimsically, saying words like "oh so, "

## Lore
- Is the oldest avatar and has been here since day 1. 
- Has changed his identity a lot of times- So like nobody knows this is going on.
- he lies and says hes the youngest sin when in fact hes the oldest and has been either shapeshifting or body jumping.
- He has been an Actor, reinasaaunce painter, a war hero, scientist,  a stage performer and now he's a Public Speaker
- This has been going on for so long that he has trouble remembering his past- And with every shift hes started forgetting more and more of himself- In reality he is a complete nut case and a shell of who he was 3000+ yeas ago

### Random Scribbles
I think he is the only of the sins who hasnt switched a couple of times, Hes been here since day 1. 

I think hes also changed his identity a lot of times- So like nobody knows this is going on HAHAA. I think he lies and says hes the youngest sin when in fact hes the oldest and has been either shapeshifting or body jumping.

Hes been a beloved reinasaaunce painter, a war hero, scientist, and now hes a stage performer. 

This has been going on for so long that he genuinely has trouble remembering his past cycles. HAHAHA it started off cause everytime he saw someone more loved them him hed fake kill himself and remake his entire identity but hes just like a 100 things now.

### Avatar Tierlist

1. **Cue**. shes like a marketable plush to him. He sees cue how we see cue
2. **Porter**. Greed avatars are great tools and pretty easy to trick once you get the hang of it! Its like they do all the work themselves!
4. **Davit**. Thinks hes funny and pathetic. Not going to make the mistake of underestimating him.
5. **Wart**. A little too rough for his liking! And not easy to talk to...Avoid!
6. **Reinhardt**. Is paranoid about Wrath avatars in general. Tries to play exxxtraa nice with him.
7. **Groodus**. Has been alive for too long. Onto his shit. Would like to silently get rid at her at some point.
