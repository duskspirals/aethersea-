Possible lore:

I think the Dark monsters or whatever are shadows that like infinitely are trying to consume "realms" or the world, like a slow hunger. 

There are the monsters and then the darklings- who i think were normal people who just got erroded over time when they got stuck there for whatever reason.

Somehow though they got out after like 1000 years, and i think the general consenseus is that the horde is mindless and only exists to consume- But theyre not. They are a Hivemind controlled by Pilav.

"he is a very lonely person. And living his entire life in the isolation did not help this. I think for whatever reason he could actually see into the normal world and has a pretty good idea of what its like.  
He kind of sees what hes doing as not 'personal', but something that 'needs' to happen. You would think its because hes getting vengence on those who inprisoned his people...but no, its because hes terrified of the extestistensial loneliness of the universe. He wants to consume every plane- to connect everyone with eachother even if its metaphorically- and once hes consumed everything he DEADASS wants to kill god and break the limitations on existence.  
â€Ž  
if ur wondering why he doesnt kill himeslf its because oblivian and any percieved afterlife does not save him from that. Moments of happiness are fleeting - He can feel everyones disconnect from eachother- He will save them"
