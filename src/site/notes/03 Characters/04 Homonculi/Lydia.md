## Lore
- She was born in the [[04 Factions/05 The Genesis Initiative\|05 The Genesis Initiative]] laboratories.
- She was born with no feelings in her body, hairless, gender neutral, no genitals, and with zero emotional capability.
- She was designed to be a solider- a prototype for their army. These were to be extremely strong- obedient, loyal, convincingly human but not enough.
- While it appeared she had no emotions on the surface- underneath she was bubbling with fury and sadness. They gave her way to high intelligence so she could comprehend how insanely fucked up this is. 
- She feels insanely depressed and lonely about her existence and is grieving her life. Sadly she can only express this through anger and completely out of nowhere with zero warning slaughtered 14 different scientists causing a lockdown as she broke out. (Including [[03 Characters/Lore Characters/Zeek\|Zeek]], Her creator, supposedly)
- She currently lives in the forest (unnamed place) and slaughters anyone who comes in. The attacks are so brutal people think theres a literal monster or pack of 20 wolves in there- making it completely off limits while [[04 Factions/04 The Navy\|04 The Navy]] tries to solve whats going on
