- He was born in [[02 Locations/Levia/Levia\|Levia]] to great poverty and just overall had a very shitty upbringing with shit parents.

- He did not- and after years of homelessness returned home...With a child. 
- Now having to support himself and his now child- he became a miner which he loathed- but he did pocket spare jewels to sell on his own- which was enough to support them.
- One day, a large group of elites came to his home- Asking for his infant child, in return for an absurd amount in *royalties.* He agreed, and quit his job- The money beginning to roll in.
- He moved back to Abyssia and formed the horribly named "[[04 Factions/Minor Factions/Carl's Group (name pending)\|Carl's Group (name pending)]]", a MLM that harvests and collects and sells [[05 Magic/Aetherium\|Aetherium]]. He treats it like a really profound distinguished rich group but hes literallyyyy just a poser running a mlm
