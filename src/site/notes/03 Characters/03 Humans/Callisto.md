## Lore

Callisto was a extremely talented scientist in her younger years. After getting married and starting a family, she gave up her dreams and was  happy and content to live with her husband and three children.

To help make ends meet, she worked part-time as an intern for [[04 Factions/01.1 The Megacorp\|01.1 The Megacorp]], and was treated prettyyy poorly due to being seen as a dumb milf and being abnormally tall. She was often called 'The Elephant Woman' Due to her massive size.

After her children all died in a horrible housefire when she was away- She developed severe psychotic depression which caused her husband to leave her shortly after.

She quit her job to start her own underground group known as [[04 Factions/05 The Genesis Initiative\|05 The Genesis Initiative]], And used her deranged intelligence to try day in and day out to recreate her children- 

After realizing her own ‘success’, she decided to be a baddie and capitalize, and now sells fake people to high end clients.

She is extremely protective and close with her own fake children and is extremely worried about them getting hurt again.
