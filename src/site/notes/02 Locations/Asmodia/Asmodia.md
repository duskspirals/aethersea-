The realm of [[03 Characters/01 The Avatars/Lust (Davit De Kleine)\|Lust (Davit De Kleine)]]


The top is more empty, a swamp. Nobody really lives here and there are abandoned relics from former/attempted civilizations.

Under the islands is a MASSIVE cave system. Its dark- with glowing purple sulphuric pools and toxic crystals jutting out of the walls



"He leads *him* inside- bringing him down deeper, and deeper- until they come across this oddly beautiful crystalized old 'church'- if you could even call it that.  sulphuric pools surround it- purple in hue...emitting these strange, lavender smelling bubbles. 

Not that it would effect *him*, but the fumes themselves are enough to melt your mind into hallucination-induced euphoria.

The interior of the church is a strange greyish color showing its age- a heavy amount of cracks in the walls with these bright crystals shooting out of them- As if infecting the church itself.
