Different Deserts, teraformed into a city, maybe its like three deserts that swirl and spiral into each other and near the center where he is they like kinda merge

- The center is a big cyberpunk city that gets more black and ashy the closer you go. its a hellscale with an insane wealth divide, but they consider themselves the most 'civilized' city in the world.  

it has a massive wall around it and do leave and enter you have to traverse this massive desert. information is also controlled so a lot of people also dont know how much is outisde of that place.


I almost imagine before him his realm was nice and pretty and vibrent and he just absoloutly ravished it of all its resources
