**Pride** - Normal forest plains area?

**Gluttony**- I think for groodus her area is a big wild westy mesa. Kinda ljke the rustlands but not quite, And mooost of it is habbitsted, but near the center is a huge lake with an incredibly biodiversity ritch island which is clearly groodusâ€™s

**Envy**  - Golden the Junjile

**Greed** - Different Deserts, teraformed into a city, maybe its like three deserts that swirl and spiral into each other and near the center where he is they like kinda merge

- The center is a big cyberpunk city that gets more black and ashy the closer you go. its a hellscale with an insane wealth divide, but they consider themselves the most 'civilized' city in the world.  

**Wrath** ice mountains

**Sloth** wadder tropics?

**Lust** - Schizo Mushroom Swamp
