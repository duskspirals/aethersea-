The realm of [[03 Characters/01 The Avatars/Envy (Cue)\|Envy (Cue)]]

i imagine its like.... a lot of reds and golds, and all the cult members live weirdly extravagant relaxed lives where they kinda have the philosiphy that cue will do all the suffering for them while they go to like stupid ballroom dances and eat stupid fancy foods

Its in a jungle, i kinda like the idea of like the """royalty""" being the eccentric wealthy few while the rest of the people have to live in this awful dangerous rainforest

kinda keeps with the envy theme. The wealthy could be very loud abt how awesome they are

i kinda imagine it being even more then a castle- like an entire walled off district, its probably a huge city youd expect would hold thousands with like, at max 200 people in it,

itwould kinda go hard if they all wore like scary gold masks


i imagine, liike, cue has a sad one and all the other ones have evil little happy ones
