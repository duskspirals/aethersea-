Grimm, the realm of [[03 Characters/01 The Avatars/Wrath (Ruisuke Reinhardt)\|Wrath (Ruisuke Reinhardt)]], While far from empty, is the most barren feeling. 

Its at the very top, and only a handful of the land is able to be inhabited by humans. 

There are 9 regions, Called 'Provinces', and each has their own culture and government. 

They are ruled by their Emperor, Who is currently Emperor [[03 Characters/01 The Avatars/Wrath (Ruisuke Reinhardt)\|Wrath (Ruisuke Reinhardt)]]

Reinhardt has the realm on a hold and wont allow any of them to go into conflict or else he'll kill them. there was a tenth region but it was completely obliterated, creating the kaldtislavian graveyards.
