The leftovers from the Solmere Dynasty- the first known kingdom in the land of Abyssia. In the middle sat an extrodinarily massive statue dedicated to King Solmere,  The first Pride Avatar

He was a ruthless leader, but cunning and charming- The world would not be where it is today was it not for his rule. Oddly enough- he never bore children, nor adopted, and instead enlisted his right hand Lysander Wadsworth to take over the ruling throne. 

Today, it would be known as The Kingdom of Abyssia- and while they did migrate a couple generations into their stay- the old ruins of Solmere remain- Along with the statue- now covered in vines and plant life. Is largely forgotten territory due to the mountainous terrain its next to it.
