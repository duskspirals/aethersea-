"Pilav stands in his 'bedroom', touching the window and looking out at the dark- almost stormy sky. Here- In this realm, it always feels like its storming though rain never drops, clear days are rare.  

Everything is Black- White, color is equally a rarity. Nobody knows how long this plane goes on for- Though a few who have gone travelling always end up back here."
